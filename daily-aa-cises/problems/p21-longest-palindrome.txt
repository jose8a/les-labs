## `longest_palindrome`
Write a function that will take a string and return the indices of the
start/end of the longest palindrome it contains.

Your palindrome checker could reverse the string and compare it to the
original, but that takes extra memory (that takes `O(n)` extra
memory). Instead, you should be able to solve the problem with `O(1)`
memory.
