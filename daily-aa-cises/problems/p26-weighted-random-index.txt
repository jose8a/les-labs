## `weighted_random_index`
Given an array, write a function that will return a random index of
the array. The probability of an index being returned is weighted by
the value at that index against the sum of the array values. For
example, for the array `[4, 6, 8]`, index 0 should be returned with 4
in 18 odds, index 1 should be returned with 6 in 18 odds, and index 2
should be return with 8 in 18 odds. Implement this in `O(n)` time.
