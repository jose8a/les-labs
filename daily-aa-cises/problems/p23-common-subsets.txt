## `common_subsets`
Write a function that takes two arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) of integers
and returns an array with all the subsets commmon to both.

Don't generate all subsets of `arr1` and `arr2`, which would take time
exponential in the size of `arr1`/`arr2` (and take `O(2**n)` memory as
well). Instead, directly generate the subsets of both.
