## `max_unique_psub`
This is a hard one! Enjoy the challenge!

Let's define a **pseudo-substring**: `psub` is a pseudo-substring of
`str` if there exists some `[i_0, i_1, ..., i_n]` such that:

* `i_0, ..., i_n` is an **increasing sequence**; `i_l < i_m` for `l < m`.
* `psub[l] == str[i_l]`

For example:
