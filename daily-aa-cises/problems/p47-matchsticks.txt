## Matchsticks
You have two sticks and a matchbox. Each stick takes exactly an hour
to burn from one end to the other.

The sticks are weird, in that they do not burn at a steady. If you
break a stick in half, it is not guaranteed that each half will take
30min to burn.

How would you measure exactly 45 minutes by burning these sticks?
