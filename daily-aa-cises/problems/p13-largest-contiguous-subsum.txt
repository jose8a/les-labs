Given an array of integers (positive and negative) find the largest
contiguous subsum (sum of a subarray).

You can solve this trivially in `O(n**2)` time by considering all
subarrays. Try to solve it in `O(n)` time with `O(1)` memory.

**Hint**:

Say for an array of `n` elements you know:

* The largest contiguous subsum, AND
* The largest contiguous subsum **ending at the last of `n`
  elements**.

Now, say that you extend the `n` elements with an `n+1`th element. How
does the largest contiguous subsum ending at the `n+1`th element
change?

How does the largest contiguous subsum change?
